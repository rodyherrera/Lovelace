 * In the vast universe of knowledge, the Open Source philosophy 
 * shines like a radiant star. In this vein, Lovelace emerges 
 * as an autonomous alternative to ChatGPT, based on 
 * open source and self-hosting capabilities.
 * 
 * Written in JavaScript, interacting with the <g4f> library written 
 * in Python, allows communication with ChatGPT through the use 
 * of different services that facilitate its use by the public.
