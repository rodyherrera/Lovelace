# In the vast universe of knowledge, the Open Source philosophy 
# shines like a radiant star. In this vein, Lovelace emerges 
# as an autonomous alternative to ChatGPT, based on 
# open source and self-hosting capabilities.
# 
# Written in JavaScript, interacting with the <g4f> library written 
# in Python, allows communication with ChatGPT through the use 
# of different services that facilitate its use by the public.
